# Athletrix Engine

Backend/engine for the Athletrix real-time multi-sport athlete monitoring platform.
The frontend lives in the separate `Athletrix_Web` repository and talks to this service over HTTP.

## Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI (HTTP API, automatic OpenAPI docs)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- pydantic-settings (configuration from environment / `.env`)

## Layout

```

  main.py            # app factory, CORS, router registration
  core/config.py     # settings (env vars / .env)
  api/router.py      # aggregates routers under /api/v1
  api/health.py      # GET  /api/v1/health
  api/athletes.py    # POST /api/v1/athletes/validate
                     # GET  /api/v1/athletes/{id}/physiological/latest, /tracking/latest
  api/samples.py     # POST /api/v1/samples/physiological, /api/v1/samples/tracking

```

## Data models

All models live in `app/models/` and are vendor-agnostic. Timestamps must be
ISO 8601 with a timezone (UTC recommended). Unknown fields are rejected.

| Model                 | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Athlete`             | Identity: id, name, jersey, sport, team   |
| `PhysiologicalSample` | HR, breathing, HRV, SpO2, temp, posture   |
| `TrackingSample`      | Position (m), speed (m/s), accel (m/s²)   |
| `DeviceStatus`        | Connection, battery %, signal quality     |

The ingest endpoints validate the payload and echo it back. Physiological and
tracking samples are kept in separate in-memory stores holding the newest
sample per athlete, and device statuses in a store holding the newest status
per device (by timestamp; ties go to the most recently received; older records
are accepted but do not replace newer ones). The `/athletes/{id}/.../latest`
and `/devices/{id}/status/latest` endpoints read these. A sample whose timestamp is
more than 5 seconds ahead of the backend's UTC clock is rejected with 422 and
the stores are left unchanged (`MAX_FUTURE_TIMESTAMP_SKEW` in
`app/core/clock.py`, an initial clock-skew allowance). Nothing is persisted
across restarts yet.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (interactive API docs)

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override defaults. `CORS_ORIGINS` must include the
origin the `Athletrix_Web` dev server runs on (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

## Demo simulator

With the backend running, send 60 seconds of fictional heart-rate data for
`athlete-1` (one sample per second) to the physiological endpoint:

```bash
python scripts/simulate_athlete.py                  # heart rate only
python scripts/simulate_athlete.py --with-tracking  # heart rate + straight-line movement
```

All simulator output is fictional demo data. Optional flags: `--seconds 10`
to run shorter, `--url http://host:port` for a different backend. With
`--with-tracking`, each second also sends a `TrackingSample` with the same
timestamp: speed rises and falls, `x_position` accumulates accordingly,
`y_position` stays at 0, and `acceleration_mps2` goes negative while slowing.
While it runs, the latest samples are visible at:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/athletes/athlete-1/physiological/latest
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/athletes/athlete-1/tracking/latest

## Running with the Athletrix_Web frontend

The frontend is a separate static site in the `Athletrix_Web` repository. Its
dashboard polls this backend for `athlete-1`'s latest sample. With this backend
running, from the `Athletrix_Web` folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Then open http://localhost:3000, click **Open the Live Demo**, and run the
simulator above to see live values. See `Athletrix_Web/README.md` for details.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```
